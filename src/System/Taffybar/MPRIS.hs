-- | This is a "Now Playing"-style widget that listens for MPRIS
-- events on DBus.  Various media players implement this.  This widget
-- only works with version 1 of the MPRIS protocol
-- (http://www.mpris.org/1.0/spec.html).  Support for version 2 will
-- be in a separate widget.
--
-- This widget isn't as configurable as the others yet - that will be
-- fixed.
